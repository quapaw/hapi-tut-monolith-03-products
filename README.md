# Breaking the Monolith by using hapi 
## Background
Let me get the disclaimer out of the way: I am not an expert on Hapi
I started looking into Hapi's ability to break components out.
This is my attempt to follow other tutorials from a hello world to a true component system.
I have broken this down into the following steps
